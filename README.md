# WindowClock

## Description

WindowClock transforms window titles into clocks, offering a novel way to keep time on your desktop.
This application is perfect for users with taskbars positioned on the left or right, providing a stylish, compact clock
that integrates seamlessly into your workspace.
With its minimalistic and customizable design, WindowClock ensures timekeeping is both elegant and innovative.

## Installation (WIP)
